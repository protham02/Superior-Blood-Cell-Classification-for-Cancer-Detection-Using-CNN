# Superior-Blood-Cell-Classification-for-Cancer-Detection-Using-CNN

# Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of 17,092 images of normal blood cells. These images were collected from individuals without any hematologic or oncologic diseases, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset for training the model.

Model Architecture
The deep learning model is built using CNNs, which have proven to be effective in image classification tasks. The architecture of the model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction followed by fully connected layers for classification.

#Training Process
The model was trained on the dataset using a standard training-validation split. The training process involved optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, thereby improving its accuracy in blood cancer detection.

#Usage
To use the trained model for blood cancer detection, simply input an image of a blood cell into the model, and it will predict the cell type with high accuracy.
